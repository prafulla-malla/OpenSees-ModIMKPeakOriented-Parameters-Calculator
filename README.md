# OpenSees ModIMKPeakOriented Parameters Calculator
A Matlab script that calculates the ModIMKPeakOriented uniaxial material parameters required to launch OpenSees analysis for buiding seismic performance.

# What is ModIMKPeakOriented?
It is a material that simulates a modified Ibarra-Medina-Krawinkler deterioration model in **OpenSees** with peak-oriented hysteretic response developed by Lignos and Krawinkler in 2012.

OpenSees is a software framework for developing applications to simulate the performance of structural and geotechnical systems subjected to earthquakes.
The goal of the OpenSees development is to improve the modeling and computational simulation in earthquake engineering through open-source development.
